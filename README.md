- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Enhanced security with the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA), ensuring that users can protect their accounts with an additional layer of security.

- **Next.js Framework**: Utilizes Next.js for its robust performance, easy routing, and server-side rendering capabilities, ensuring a smooth user experience across all devices.

- **Drizzle ORM**: Leveraging Drizzle as the ORM for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient and type-safe database operations.

- **PostgreSQL Database**: Reliable and scalable data storage with PostgreSQL, providing powerful query capabilities and strong data integrity.
